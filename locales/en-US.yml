promotion_tutorial_example_desc: The rebates on this site are based on valid bets,
  assuming the rebate ratio is shown in the table in the upper left corner. A was
  the first to discover business opportunities on this site and immediately developed
  B1, B2 and B3. B1 then developed C1 and C2. B2 had no subordinates, and B3 only
  developed the relatively powerful C3.
promotion_tutorial_example_desc1: A few days later, B1’s effective bet is
  80,000, B2’s effective bet is 50,000, B3’s effective bet is 30,000, C1’s effective
  bet is 100,000, C2’s effective bet is 40,000, and C3 My effective bet reaches
  710,000, then the total performance of B1 comes from C1 and C2, which is 140,000,
  and the corresponding rebate ratio is 80/10,000; the performance of B2 without
  subordinates is 0; the subordinate C3 of B3 is powerful, the total performance
  is 710,000, and the corresponding rebate is The ratio is 1 million/10,000; A has
  160,000 from the direct team and 850,000 from other teams. The total performance
  is 1.01 million, and the corresponding rebate ratio is 1 million/10,000.
promotion_tutorial_example_desc2: Then the income between them is calculated as follows
promotion_tutorial_example_desc3: It refers to members who develop vertically and are collectively called direct teams.
promotion_tutorial_direct_team_1: "(1) B1, B2, and B3 contribute to A: (80,000 +
  50,000 + 30,000) x 100/10,000 = 1,600."
promotion_tutorial_direct_team_2: "(2) C1 and C2 contribute to B1: (100,000+40,000)x80/10,000=1120."
promotion_tutorial_direct_team_3: "(3) C3 contributes to B3: 710,000 x 100/10,000
  = 7100."
promotion_tutorial_other_team_1: It refers to the members who develop into subordinates,
  subordinates, subordinates, etc., and are collectively called other teams; because
  this system can develop subordinates infinitely, for the convenience of explanation,
  this article only takes the 2-level structure as an example.
promotion_tutorial_other_team_2: "(1) From C1 and C2: Because B1 has a total performance
  of 140,000 and only enjoys a rebate ratio of 80/ten thousand, while A’s total
  performance is 1.01 million and enjoys a rebate ratio of 1 million/ten thousand,
  then there is a rebate between A and B1 The commission difference is: 100-80=20/10,000.
  This difference is the part contributed by C1 and C2 to A, so C1 and C2 contribute
  to A: (100,000+40,000)×20/10,000=280."
promotion_tutorial_other_team_3: "(2) From C3: Since B3 has a total performance
  of 710,000 and enjoys a rebate ratio of 1 million/10,000, and A has a total performance
  of 1.01 million and enjoys a rebate ratio of 1 million/10,000, then the rebate
  difference between A and B3 is: 100-100=0/10,000, C3 contributes to A: 710,000x0/10,000=0."
promotion_tutorial_summary_1: "(1) C3 is so powerful that it indirectly allows A
  to enjoy a higher commission rate for all its performance."
promotion_tutorial_summary_2: "(2) B2 may be lazy and will not benefit if he does
  not develop his subordinates."
promotion_tutorial_summary_3: "(3) Although B3 joined relatively late and is a subordinate
  of A, its subordinate C3 is very powerful, allowing B3 to directly enjoy a higher
  commission ratio. Therefore, no matter when B3 joins, whose subordinate he is,
  no matter what level he is in, Income will never be affected, you will no longer
  suffer from the losses of other people's subordinates, and your development will
  not be restricted."
promotion_tutorial_summary_4: "(4) This is an absolutely fair and just agency model,
  and no one will be stepped on forever just because they join late."
